lnwjud preserves the pinned AgentShield package metadata as the source of truth and normalizes the packaged AgentShield CLI version at its owned wrapper boundary. This avoids exposing a conflicting upstream hard-coded CLI version string while keeping the original bundled runtime intact and separately hashed in provenance.

## Integration boundary

ECC content is imported as a pinned provider and activated selectively. Imported rules, hooks, workflows, MCP templates, memories, and instincts do not override lnwjud permissions, durable-goal ownership, mutation policy, or runtime security boundaries. Executable ECC hooks/workflows and MCP templates are not auto-started by discovery.
